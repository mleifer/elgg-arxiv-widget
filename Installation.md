  1. Log in as an administrator and go to "Administration->Tool Administration"
  1. Find the "elgg-arxiv-widget" entry and click "Enable"

After installation, you should see a new widget called "Recent arXiv Eprints" in your widget gallery.  You can find this by going to either your profile or your dashboard and clicking on "Edit page".
